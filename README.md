Hi, I’m Malik 👋
Self-Taught Cloud & AI Engineer | AWS • Terraform • Python
I build production-ready cloud infrastructure and AI-powered solutions. My work focuses on serverless architectures, infrastructure automation, and integrating LLMs into scalable systems. I’m passionate about designing resilient, event-driven cloud systems that solve real-world problems.
🚀 What I’m Building
I’m currently focused on:
	•	Serverless Architecture – Designing scalable systems with Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB
	•	Infrastructure as Code – Building reusable Terraform modules for multi-environment deployments
	•	AI Integration – Implementing LLM workflows using AWS Bedrock, RAG patterns, and agentic systems
	•	Cloud Automation – Creating event-driven architectures with EventBridge and Step Functions
	•	Continuous Learning – Pursuing AWS Solutions Architect Professional and expanding into MLOps
