👋 Hi, I’m Malik

Self-Taught Cloud & AI Engineer

AWS • Terraform • Python • Serverless Architecture

I build production-ready cloud infrastructure and AI-powered systems. My focus is on serverless design, infrastructure automation, and integrating LLMs into scalable architectures. I’m passionate about building resilient, event-driven cloud platforms that solve real-world problems.

⸻

🚀 What I’m Working On
	•	Serverless Architecture – Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB
	•	Infrastructure as Code – Modular Terraform for multi-env deployments
	•	AI Integration – LLM workflows using AWS Bedrock, RAG, agentic patterns
	•	Cloud Automation – EventBridge + Step Functions for event-driven systems
	•	Continuous Learning – SA Pro track + expanding into MLOps
